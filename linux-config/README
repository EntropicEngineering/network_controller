#To configure the AMM Router
sudo apt-mark hold firmware-atheros lxqt* liblxqt* (to prevent driver and GUI crashes)
sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target (disable suspend due to known issues with suspend/resume stability)
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade (repeat this until autoremove, update and upgrade no longer yield new actions, reboots and dpkg commands may be required as the system shuts down due to one of the updates) 
sudo apt install dnsmasq nftables hostapd
sudo reboot

move contents of .../linux-config/etc into /etc

sudo systemctl enable nftables
sudo systemctl start nftables
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo reboot
